**Motivation**

The project was an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with C++ classes and to learn how to create visual components like buttons and textboxes using the SFML library.

**Main Challenges**
1. Match-Type Questions. (Updating, editing, and deleting this type of question proved to be the most complex due to its unique structure)

2. Synchronization Between Logic and UI. (The editing and deletion processes required consistent updates to both the underlying data structure (map) and the visual components)
